# Glitter - Ridders

This project contains a set of activities designed to introduce kids to coding and electronics in a fun and interactive way.

We use the python language to make it easy to pick up coding concepts, and we use the Raspberry Pi as a hardward platform and tie in various sensors, buttons, and LEDs.

These activities are designed for children between the ages of 7-13, and can be done indvidually or in group settings at home or in a classroom.

Check out each sub-folder for specifics on hardware needed and instructions to setup and install software.

Okay, enough of the boring stuff...

## Are You Ready to Stop Evil Dr. Glitter?!

### Activity 1: Find one of Dr. Glitter's Glitterbugs

This activity uses a Raspberry Pi with 2 ultrasonic sensors to locate a glitter bug on a board. Learn how ultrasonic sensors and triangulation work to let you "see" in the dark, just like bats and whales.

### Activity 2: Inspect one of Dr. Glitter's Devices

This activity uses a Raspberry Pi with a ReSpeaker 2-mic HAT, which adds a button, LEDS, and microphones. Control the LEDs, buttons, and use keyword detection to unlock clues.

### Activity 3: De-Fuse Dr. Glitter's Glitter-Bomb

This activity uses a Raspberry Pi with a camera, some LEDs, a clock display and a servo motor to create an automatic glitter bomb. Use the camera to detect the right image and disconnect the right wire to stop the timer before you get covered in glitter!
